# Rust Innovation Lab Financial Procedures

It’s up to each project to decide how to spend their [funding.md](funding) – and to decide their own process for allocating it. Some projects will have a single Project Lead who makes all the decisions. Others may have a committee of maintainers, and will need to decide how to make spending decisions as a group.

## Acceptable and Unacceptable Expenditure

Common expenses for open source projects are website or other hosting costs, travel to conferences and events, paying someone to work on the project. You should provide clear and public guidance to your contributors about what types of expenses you’re willing to cover, and for whom. _There must be no personal use of project funds, and political campaign activity is prohibited._ We encourage projects to discuss large or unusual expenses with Foundation staff before committing to them.

## Roles and Responsibilities

It’s the responsibility of the project’s financial decisionmaker to ensure that all expenses, invoices, etc are valid – that the submitter has legitimately incurred it on behalf of the project, that they have included any supporting documentation such as receipts where appropriate, and that they’ve provided banking information for reimbursement.

The financial decisionmaker should then send the expenditure request to the Rust Foundation via email to accounting@rustfoundation.org. Foundation staff will review it to ensure that it’s legally and fiscally valid (= consistent with our tax-exempt status under IRC Section 501(c)(6)), and will then pay it out of the project’s funds.
