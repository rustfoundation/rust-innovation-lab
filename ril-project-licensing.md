# Rust Innovation Lab’s Project Licensing Policy

Our approach to licensing is detailed in the [Rust Foundation Intellectual Property Policy](https://rustfoundation.org/policy/intellectual-property-policy/) – please also read this.

In summary:

Your project **must** use an open source license that clearly defines how your project can be used, modified, redistributed, and referenced by others. We will not be able to accept it into the Rust Innovation Lab if it does not have a suitable license. As a general guideline, any license that will be accepted into the RIL should come from the list of [OSI approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses). If the project license is a stronger copyleft license, such as AGPL, there will need to be a discussion of how that may affect previous, current and future contributions to the project within the RIL.


The Rust Foundation’s default is Apache/MIT dual-licensing. Once a project has joined the Lab, all _new_ code contributions must follow either this licensing or the current approved project licensing, unless agreed to by both the RIL project and the Foundation that a different license may be used.

Documentation, media and other non-code content must also be made available under an appropriate open license, such as CC-BY-4.0.

## CLA

We do not require that projects have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), but we do require that all contributions are made under the project’s open source license and that contributors affirm they have the rights to submit their work.
