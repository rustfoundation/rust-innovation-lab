# About the Rust Innovation Lab

The Rust Innovation Lab (RIL) is a place in which projects working with the Rust Programming Language can develop and mature, supported by the Rust Foundation acting as the project’s ‘fiscal sponsor’. 

The RIL is managed and governed by the Rust Foundation and its Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has the final say on which projects are accepted into the RIL.

## What we offer to Rust Innovation Lab projects

The Rust Foundation will provide on-boarding support, financial and legal support, promotional and infrastructure support, to RIL projects, in line with the needs and desires of each project.
