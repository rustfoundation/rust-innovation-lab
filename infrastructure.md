# Rust Innovation Lab’s Project Infrastructure Policy

When a project joins the Rust Innovation Lab, its existing technical assets become part of the Rust Foundation’s managed infrastructure to provide the project with long-term stability and stewardship.

## Initial Migration

As part of the onboarding process, the project and the Rust Foundation will work together to inventory the project’s existing technical infrastructure. This may include, but is not limited to:
- Source code repositories
- Documentation
- Issue trackers
- Collaboration tools
- Domain names and websites
- Logos and other potential marks

Code, documentation or other repositories that are owned and managed by the project will be migrated to the Rust Foundation GitHub organization or other official Foundation-managed services as appropriate. All future development work will be expected to occur in these Foundation-managed spaces.

## Access and Security

Project maintainers will be granted the appropriate write and administrative access to manage their technical assets. The Foundation reserves the right to hold ultimate ownership of credentials, accounts, domains, etc, as part of its remit to ensure the continuity of the project if, for example, its current maintainers become unavailable.

The project must provide the Foundation with at least billing-level access (administrator-level access may also be required) to any external services utilized within the project.

The project will provide details and appropriate access to areas that are used to secure their project, including, but not limited to, backup and recovery, cloud services, etc.

## Costs and Billing

The Rust Foundation will manage the costs and payments associated with infrastructure services used by the project, and these will be paid for out of the project’s budget.

Projects should coordinate with the Foundation’s technical staff before provisioning new third-party services, to ensure value for money is obtained and to prevent duplication of services.

## Exceptions

If there are strong reasons for a project to maintain certain assets outside of the Rust Foundation’s infrastructure, we will consider exceptions. These must be approved by the Foundation in advance and the project will still be expected to provide an adequate level of access and documentation to Foundation staff to enable continuity and financial oversight.
