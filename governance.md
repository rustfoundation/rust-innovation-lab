# Rust Innovation Lab's Project Governance Policy

## Documented Governance

To ensure stability, transparency, and effective communication between Rust Innovation Lab projects and the Rust Foundation, all projects are expected to maintain clear governance practices following the principles outlined below.

Each project must have a `governance.md` file in its main GitHub repository that describes how it operates. Governance structures should be reviewed periodically and updated as the project evolves.

## Project Leadership

The project must designate two or more leaders or administrators (unless there is only a single Project Lead) to serve as the primary contacts with the Rust Foundation. These individuals will act as the main points of communication for operational, administrative, and financial matters. Any changes to the designated contacts must be communicated promptly to the Rust Foundation.

## Governance Principles

We do not impose a rigid governance structure on projects, but we strongly encourage the adoption of practices that promote openness, accountability, and long-term sustainability. Projects should maintain contributor guidelines and onboarding documentation to make it easy for new contributors to understand how they can get involved. Processes for appointing leadership should be transparent and merit-based.

Because leadership changes are inevitable, projects should ensure there is a clear plan for the transition of responsibilities if key maintainers step down. This plan should also include a wind-down process in the event the project cannot continue, specifying how its remaining funds, assets, and intellectual property will be handled.
